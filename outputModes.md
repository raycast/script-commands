In `fullOutput` the entire output is presented on a separate view, similar to a terminal window. This is handy when your script generates output to consume.

In `compact` mode the last line of the standard output is shown in the toast

In `silent` mode the last line (if exists) will be shown in overlaying HUD toast after Raycast window is closed.

In `inline` mode, the first line of output will be directly shown in the command item and automatically refresh according to the specified `refreshTime`. Tip: Set your dashboard items as favourites via the action menu in Raycast
