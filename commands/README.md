# Raycast Script Commands

[Raycast](https://raycast.com) lets you control your tools with a few keystrokes
and Script Commands makes it possible to execute scripts from anywhere on your desktop.
They are a great way to speed up every-day tasks such as converting data, opening bookmarks
or triggering dev workflows.
