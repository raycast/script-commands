#+title: Raycast script commands for Quip

This set of script commands makes it possible to easily create and add text to different types of Quip documents. They complement the existing Raycast [[https://www.raycast.com/justin0u0/quip][Quip extension]], which provides support for searching and viewing Quip documents.

With these scripts you can create commands to do one of two actions:

- =create=: Create new Quip documents in predefined folders, optionally based on predefined templates (e.g. type =mnote Meeting title= to automatically create a new document in your "Meeting notes" folder, using an appropriate template). You can define as many different "create" actions as you need.
- =add=: Add text to an existing Quip document, optionally formatted as list items (e.g. type =todo Update the documentation= to add a todo item to your "Action items" document). You can define as many "add" actions as you need.

You can customize the behavior during and after these actions, including the following:
- Open the created/updated document automatically (and whether to use the Quip app or the web browser for this)
- Copy the URL of the created/updated document to the clipboard.
- Prepend the current date to the title of newly created documents or added text.
- Use different templates for each type of document created.
- The Quip folder in which to store each type of created document.
- Produce notifications after each command finishes execution.

* Configuration and use

To get set up, do the following:

1. Check out this repository and add the =quip= directory as a Script Directory in the Raycast preferences:

2. Copy =quip_config.template.ini= to =quip_config.ini= and customize it to your needs. You need to set at least the following values:
   - =APIToken= to your Quip personal API token. You can get one at https://quip.com/api/personal-token (the URL may be different if you are using a Quip Enterprise instance with a custom domain).
   - If you are using a custom Quip domain, modify =BaseURL= and =APIURL= accordingly.
   - Configure the actions you want. See the examples in the template for details on how to configure them.
3. Once your configuration is complete, run from Raycast the "Set up Quip commands" command. This will ask you for confirmation and then generate scripts corresponding to your configuration, which will be loaded automatically by Raycast.

4. You can now use the generated commands to create or add text to Quip documents. You can of course configure aliases or hotkeys for the commands you need the most in the Raycast Script Commands settings.

5.  Note that you can also run the generated scripts from the command line to execute the corresponding actions. For example:
   #+begin_src shell
./quip-new-note.py "New note title"
   #+end_src
6. If you need to update or modify your config (e.g. to add or remove actions), make sure you rerun the "Set up Quip commands" command afterwards, to ensure the scripts are kept up to date.
