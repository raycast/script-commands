# Contributing to Raycast's Toolkit

Raycast Toolkit is a command-line application for automating repetitive tasks in this repo. At the moment the Toolkit automates the generation of the [Awesome Script Commands](../../commands/README.md) and the [extensions.json](../../extensions.json) which contains information about each Script Command.
